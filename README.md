# Project Name- Melanoma Cancer Detection using CNN

> Outline a brief description of your project.
Problem statement: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma.
Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. 
A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the
presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Models
3 models were made, first was a basic CNN model, in the second one, I tried data augmentation by tweaking and zooming the images a bit, in the third 
option, I made use of the augmentor library to handle class imbalance and this one yeilded the best results and also helped with the problem of 
overfitting which was occuring in the initial two models. 

## Conclusions
- I have used data augmentation and made use of the augmentor library to set up the CNN model. I have also used dropout layers.
- Training accuracy- 88% and Validation accuracy- 82%
- Problem of overfitting can be solved by adding more layers, neurons or adding more dropout layers.
